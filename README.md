The purpose of this repository is to house the software (RMarkdown file) behind our data dashboard that goes with Autodidact, and to serve as a test key for the questions that are used in our data dashboard.
The survey data and questions were taken from the publically available dataset concerning COVID-19 and technology use on student's performance from a Jordanian university (please see the following link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920309987). Our VR data were generated by us and, with the aide of SMOTE (please refer to the following: https://towardsdatascience.com/smote-fdce2f605729), synthesized 73 students whose distributions matched our sampled set.
